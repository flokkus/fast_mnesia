To build this code, run the following commands:

erlc -o ./simple_cache/ebin ./simple_cache/src/*.erl
erlc -o ./resource_discovery/ebin ./resource_discovery/src/*.erl

First start one or two contact nodes. Ensure that the default
node names in sc_app:ensure_contact() match your host name, and/or
use -sname instead of -name. (Edit and recompile if necessary.)
For example, in a separate terminal window, do:

erl -name contact1

To run the program, start Erlang like this:

erl -name mynode -pa ./simple_cache/ebin -pa ./resource_discovery/ebin/

Then, run the following in the Erlang shell:

1> application:start(sasl).
ok
2> mnesia:start().
ok
3> application:start(resource_discovery).
ok
4> application:start(simple_cache).
ok
5> 

(Remember that the resource discovery will make simple_cache
wait several seconds when it starts.)

For more fun, start one or two other nodes in the same
way (with different names, of course), and start the same
applications on them. Then try inserting something in the
cache on one node, and looking it up on another node.
