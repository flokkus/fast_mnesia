To build this code, run the following commands (or run compile.sh):

erlc -o ./tcp_interface/ebin ./tcp_interface/src/*.erl
erlc -o ./gen_web_server/ebin ./gen_web_server/src/*.erl
erlc -pa ./gen_web_server/ebin -o ./http_interface/ebin ./http_interface/src/*.erl
erlc -o ./simple_cache/ebin ./simple_cache/src/*.erl
erlc -o ./resource_discovery/ebin ./resource_discovery/src/*.erl

Then run the following (all on a single line) to generate the .boot file:

erl -noshell -pa ./simple_cache/ebin -pa ./resource_discovery/ebin -eval 'systools:make_script("simple_cache", [local])' -s init stop

Start the simple_cache system as in chapter 10 (including a contact node),
but also including the paths to the ebin directories of tcp_interface,
gen_web_server, and http_interface:

erl -sname contact1 -detached
erl -sname mynode -pa ./tcp_interface/ebin -pa ./gen_web_server/ebin -pa ./http_interface/ebin -pa ./simple_cache/ebin -pa ./resource_discovery/ebin/ -boot ./simple_cache -config sys

(The node discovery waits a few seconds at startup.)

Then, from the Erlang shell, run:

application:start(tcp_interface).
application:start(http_interface).

You can now e.g. run appmon:start() to inspect the system and check that
tcp_interface is running alongside the other applications.

After that, open another terminal window and use telnet
to connect to the TCP interface, like this:

$ telnet localhost 1155
Trying 127.0.0.1...
Connected to localhost.localdomain.
Escape character is '^]'.
lookup[foo]
OK:{error,not_found}.
insert[foo,bar]
OK:ok.
lookup[foo]
OK:{ok,bar}.
delete[foo]
OK:ok.
lookup[foo]
OK:{error,not_found}.

Or, use a command-line HTTP client like 'curl' to connect
to the HTTP interface:

$ curl -T put.txt http://localhost:1156/xyzzy
$ curl http://localhost:1156/xyzzy
Erlang

(if the file put.txt contains the text "Erlang"). You can
also use a normal web browser and enter a URL such as
http://localhost:1156/xyzzy in the address field. Note that
the HTTP interface stores text as binaries in the cache,
so for example, to look up the key xyzzy from the TCP
interface, you have to enter the query like this:

lookup[<<"xyzzy">>]
OK:{ok,<<"Erlang\n">>}.
